- **Shareable URLs**: Generate unique URLs for accessing your data from any device
- **End-to-end Encryption**: Protect sensitive data with a password to restrict access. The password is hashed and used to encrypt your data - only **you** can see it (not even us)

2. Hit _Save_ to generate a unique URL
3. Use the URL to access your data from any other device
